        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a 17-year-old programmer from Poland specializing in web
          technologies. I have been learning JavaScript the longest (since 2018)
          and know this language very well. When writing code, I strive to use
          good patterns and practices. I am a quick learner. Since 2022, I have
          been self-taught, and during this time, I have learned many
          technologies such as TypeScript, MongoDB, and MySQL. I also have the
          ability to use Linux and am familiar with basic terminal commands.

              I am on programmer profile where we are taught multiple things:
              MFC, PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Object-Oriented C++, and much
              more in further.

            <h3>ZST Timetable</h3>
            <p>
              The timetable page of my school is ugly, so I decided to make it
              better. I wrote an API that fetches data from the school's
              original website using an external library, aggregates it, and
              sends it to the client. I also created a frontend that is much
              more visually appealing and, most importantly, well-suited for
              mobile devices

            <p>
              I wanted to organize the knowledge I was gaining in school and, at
              the same time, help my classmates study for tests. So, I created a
              platform in React with documentation for exams and quizzes. The
              data is uploaded via a JSON file to avoid the need for creating a
              backend. To make things easier, I built an editor that generates
              JSON based on the data entered into the appropriate text fields.

            <p>
              As I mentioned, I am self-taught and used The Odin Project course.
              During the course, I built a store website that fetches data from
              the Fake Store API and includes a cart mechanism (i.e., the user
              can add and remove products from the cart). While creating it, I
              learned how to use the React Router library.
